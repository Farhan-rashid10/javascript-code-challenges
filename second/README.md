# Car Speed Checker Program
## Description
This program takes the speed of a car as input and checks if it is within the acceptable speed limit. The acceptable speed limit is set to 70 km/h. If the speed is below 70 km/h, the program will print "Ok". If the speed exceeds 70 km/h, the program will calculate and print the number of demerit points the driver earns. For every 5 km/h over the speed limit, the driver earns one demerit point.

## Features
Checks if the car speed is within the acceptable limit (70 km/h).
Prints "Ok" if the speed is less than 70 km/h.
Calculates and prints the number of demerit points if the speed exceeds 70 km/h.
For every 5 km/h above the speed limit, the driver earns one demerit point.

# Usage
Prerequisites
A web browser with JavaScript enabled or a Node.js environment.
Running the Program
Copy the JavaScript code provided below.
Open a web browser and press F12 to open the developer console, or use a text editor to create a .js file and run it using Node.js.
Paste the code into the console or the .js file and execute it.

# Notes
The speed is expected to be entered in kilometers per hour (km/h).
Ensure that the input is a valid number to avoid errors.
The program uses prompt for input and console.log for output, which works well in a browser environment. If you are using Node.js, you might need to use readline for input.
